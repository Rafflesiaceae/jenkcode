# About
erm... it encodes/decodes stdin to groovy single-quote string literals, because
the menagerie of groovy string literals are all maximally unintuitive and pretty
much a complete mess

because probably most groovy users at this point are or will be people dealing
with jenkins as gradle is moving to kotlin, might as well call it jenkode and
not groovcode, it's also just objectively a better name

have a good day/night
